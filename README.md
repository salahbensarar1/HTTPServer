A simple HTTP Server in Java, which can listen to HTTP requests on a port let's say 80 and can send a response to the client. 
Being an HTTP Server, you can connect to it using your browser e.g. Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. 
Though HTTP is ubiquitous and present everywhere, Java doesn't have a dedicated API to create and parse HTTP requests, there is no in-built HTTP client library in JDK.
